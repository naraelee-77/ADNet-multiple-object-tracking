# Multiple Object Tracking

- In this project we use deep reinforcement learning for multiple object tracking
- Datasets used:
  - Large Area Image Recorder (LAIR): High altitude grayscale videos of cars taken by UAVs/drones. Each frame is stitched/cropped from multiple drones, so effectively nearly still-camera.
  - Multiple Object Tracking Challenge (MOT): Videos of pedestrians on the street. Includes still-camera and moving-camera, and multiple perspectives

### Participation in REU
This was a project worked on during the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Central Florida's Center of Research for Computer Vision (UCF CRCV) in Summer 2018. [[Link to Page]](http://crcv.ucf.edu/REU/2018/narae)
